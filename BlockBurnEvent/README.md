#### Description
> **Event:** BlockBurnEvent  
> **Package:** org.bukkit.event.block.BlockBurnEvent  
> **Plugin Type/Title:** Created a new implementation of charcoal that spawns when you burn wood.  
> **Notes:** Not many plugins you can make with BlockBurnEvent. I was initially thinking of a new type of portal but the block would not burn, that would be more of an interactive event but I have more planned for that event when it comes to it.
